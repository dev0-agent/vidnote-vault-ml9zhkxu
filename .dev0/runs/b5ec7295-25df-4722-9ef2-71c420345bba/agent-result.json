{"status":"success","commitMessage":"feat: implement data export and import functionality\n\n- Add SettingsView component with export and import buttons\n- Implement replaceLibrary in storage.ts with Zod validation\n- Integrate SettingsView into the main App layout\n- Add 'Clear All Data' functionality in Settings","prTitle":"Data Export and Import","prBody":"This PR adds a Settings page to VidNote Vault, allowing users to export their library data as a JSON file and import it back. This is essential for maintaining backups of their local-only data.\n\nKey changes:\n- Created `src/components/settings-view.tsx` containing the UI for export, import, and clearing data.\n- Updated `src/lib/storage.ts` to include `replaceLibrary` which validates the imported JSON using Zod.\n- Integrated the Settings page into the main application navigation in `src/App.tsx`.\n- Added a 'Danger Zone' in Settings to allow users to clear all their data with a confirmation dialog.","notes":"The import functionality strictly validates the JSON structure using the existing Zod schema to ensure data integrity. The export functionality generates a timestamped JSON file."}
