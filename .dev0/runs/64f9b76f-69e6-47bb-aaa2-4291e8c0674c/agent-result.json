  "prTitle": "Build Video Grid Dashboard",
  "prBody": "This PR implements the main dashboard view for VidNote Vault.\n\nKey changes:\n- **VideoCard Component**: Displays YouTube thumbnails (mqdefault), titles, and tags. Includes a delete action with confirmation dialog.\n- **VideoGrid Component**: Fetches videos from localStorage, supports real-time search filtering, and offers grid/list view toggles.\n- **App Integration**: Replaced placeholder library view with the functional VideoGrid.\n- **Empty States**: Added helpful empty states for empty library and no search results.\n- **Cross-Component Sync**: Uses a custom `video-added` event to refresh the grid when a new video is added via the dialog.",
  "notes": "The implementation uses `mqdefault.jpg` for YouTube thumbnails to ensure consistency. It also includes an `AlertDialog` for deletions to prevent accidental data loss. Search functionality covers both titles and tags."
