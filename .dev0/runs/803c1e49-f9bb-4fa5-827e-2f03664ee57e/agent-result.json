{"status":"success","commitMessage":"feat(video-player): implement VideoPlayer component using react-youtube with imperative controls","prTitle":"feat(video-player): implement VideoPlayer component","prBody":"Implemented a reusable `VideoPlayer` component that wraps `react-youtube`. It uses `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` to expose playback controls (seekTo, getCurrentTime, pauseVideo, playVideo) to parent components, enabling the requirement for clicking a note timestamp to seek the video.","notes":"Installed `react-youtube` dependency."}
