  "commitMessage": "feat: implement localStorage repository with Zod validation\n\n- Created src/lib/storage.ts for persistent data management\n- Implemented getLibrary, saveVideo, deleteVideo, addNote, and deleteNote\n- Added Zod schema validation for data integrity\n- Added error handling for localStorage quota limits\n- Installed zod dependency",
  "prTitle": "Implement LocalStorage Repository",
  "prBody": "This PR implements the `lib/storage.ts` utility which serves as the persistence layer for VidNote Vault using `localStorage`. \n\nKey features:\n- **Zod Validation**: Ensures data read from storage conforms to expected types.\n- **Quota Management**: Properly handles and reports `QuotaExceededError`.\n- **Atomic Operations**: Functions for managing videos and notes independently while maintaining library consistency (e.g., deleting a video also removes its notes).\n- **Upsert Logic**: `saveVideo` and `addNote` handle both creation and updates.",
  "notes": "Installed `zod` as it was a requirement but not present in the initial dependencies. Verified code with `tsc --noEmit`."
